    "## Implementation\n",
    "First, we use the provided solver.py library to solve the given differential equations. The model for these equations is as follows:\n",
    "*d/dt·y(t) = v(t), d/dt·v(t) = -kv(t)²/m - g*\n",
    "Input parameters: Initial conditions *y(0) = 0,v(0) = a,time step ▲ t*,termination time *T*,and model parameters *($m, k, g$)*\n",
    "Method: solver supports multiple explicit solvers, including Heun, Ralston, and Runge-Kutta.\n",
    "For the nonlinear problem *F(a) = y(T;a) - H = 0*,we implemented the bisection and secant methods to solve for the initial velocity such that *y(T) = H*.\n",
    "### Code Workflow:\n",
    "Use the solver function to solve the differential equations, returning time and height *y*.\n",
    "Define *F(a) as y(T)−H*, and use numerical methods (bisection, secant method) to solve *F(a)=0.*\n",
    "Simulate the three methods with different time steps Δ*t*, and plot the curve of height *y* versus time *t*.\n"

    "## Results\n",
    "We performed solutions for the following two scenarios:\n",
    "**Test 1**: Solving the differential equation alone, with parameters set as *m=1,g=10,k=0.1,a=15,T=1.*\n",
    "**Test 2**: Solving the combined problem of differential equations and nonlinear root-finding, with parameters set as *m=1.3,g=9.81,k=0.05,T=1.5,H=10.0.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results of Bisection and Secant Methods\n",
    "**Bisection Method**: The initial velocity was found to be approximately *a≈14.9998.*\n",
    "**Secant Method**: The initial velocity was found to be approximately *a≈15.0001.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical Results\n",
    "For each solver (**Heun**, **Ralston**, **Runge-Kutta**), we plotted the altitude *y(t)* with different time steps (*Δt*):\n",
    "**Time steps**: *Δt=0.1,0.05,0.025,0.0125,0.00625.*\n",
    "**Observation:** As the time step decreases, the numerical solutions converge, and the three methods show consistent performance under smaller time steps."

    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the analysis of the results, we reached the following conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numerical Accuracy**:The three methods (**Heun**, **Ralston**, and **Runge-Kutta**) all demonstrated stable performance. However, as the time step *Δt* decreases, the computational cost increases significantly.\n",
    "2. **Precision**:The **Runge-Kutta** method exhibited the smallest error under the same step size.The **Heun** and **Ralston** methods performed well, but their errors were higher compared to the **Runge-Kutta** method.\n",
    "3. **Convergence**:For relatively large time steps *(Δt=0.1),* all methods showed certain errors, indicating that smaller step sizes are more suitable for precision.\n",
    "4. **Nonlinear Root-Finding**: The **Bisection Method** is easy to implement but converges relatively slowly.The **Secant Method** converges faster but is sensitive to the estimation of the initial value."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the analysis of different solvers, we recommend the following combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Runge-Kutta Method: Performs best for solving differential equations, with higher accuracy and suitability for most scenarios.\n",
    "2. Secant Method: More efficient when solving nonlinear equations *F(a)=0,* making it suitable for quickly determining the initial velocity.\n",
